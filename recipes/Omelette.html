        <h3> <strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="bella">2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li class="bella">Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li class="bella">Fillings (such as grated cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, or herbs)</li>
          <li class="bella">Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together until the yolks and whites are well combined. You can add a pinch of salt and pepper to season the eggs at this stage.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is heated, pour the beaten eggs into the pan and let them cook for a few seconds until the edges start to set.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, gently push the cooked edges of the omelette towards the center, tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges. Repeat this process until most of the eggs are cooked, but the top is still slightly runny.</li>
            <li>Add your desired fillings, such as grated cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, or herbs, to one side of the omelette.  Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press down gently with the spatula to ensure the filling is secured inside</li>         
            <li>Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Press down gently with the spatula to ensure the filling is secured inside.</li>
            <li>Cook the omelette for another minute or so, until the cheese has melted (if using) and the eggs are fully cooked but still moist.</li>
            <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately. You can garnish it with additional herbs or a sprinkle of grated cheese, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
