     <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
     <ul>
        <li class="bella">Ground beef (80% lean and 20% fat is a good ratio for juiciness)</li>
        <li class="bella">Hamburger buns</li>
        <li class="bella">Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li class="bella">Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li class="bella">Sliced onions</li>
        <li class="bella">Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li class="bella">Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise (optional)</li>
        <li class="bella">Salt and pepper for seasoning</li>
        <li class="bella">Olive oil or vegetable oil for cooking</li>
     </ul>
     <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Preparing the Patties:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, take the ground beef and season it with salt and pepper according to your taste. Gently mix the seasoning into the meat.</li>
            <li>Divide the beef into equal portions, typically around 1/4 to 1/3 pound (113g)</li>
            <li>Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb. This helps the patty cook more evenly.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Cooking the Patties:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. You can also use a stovetop grill pan or griddle.</li>
            <li>If using a skillet, add a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness</li>
            <li>If adding cheese, place a slice on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking, allowing it to melt.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Assembling the Burger:</li>
            <ul>
             <li>Slice the hamburger buns in half and lightly toast them if desired.</li>
             <li>Spread condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the bottom half of the bun.</li>
             <li>Place the cooked patty on top of the condiments.</li>
             <li>Add lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, onions, and pickles on top of the patty.</li>
             <li>Place the top half of the bun on the assembled ingredients.</li>
             </ul>
            <li>Serving the Burger:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You can wrap the burger in wax paper or parchment paper for easier handling.</li>
                <li>Serve the burger with your favorite side dishes like french fries, coleslaw, or a salad.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your homemade burger!</li>
